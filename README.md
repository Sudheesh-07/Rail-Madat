# rail_madat

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
Rail Madat is a tech-driven emergency assistance and support system for Indian Railways. This platform connects **passengers**, **railway authorities**, **medical teams**, and **nearby support systems** through a unified web application — providing fast, transparent, and verified help when it’s needed most.
